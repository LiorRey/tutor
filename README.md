# Tutor - Sharing Towards Excellence üë®üèª‚Äçüè´

Tutor is an open-source application for students, made by students.
Using Tutor, you can share helpful information you have stumbled upon online, summaries you wrote, and have all the information you need for every course at the tip of your fingertips.

Sign up to the subjects your'e enrolled in and see what helped other students understand the material better and get great grades in the course. 

If your school uses Moodle, Tutor can automatically check for updated HW grades and display your grades in one simple-to-use dashboard, so you know where your'e standing.

# App Components

## Backend

Implemented with Flask using the following components:

1. DB for all courses available in the app
2. DB for each course, filled with the data relevant for that specific app.
3. User has the ability to add and remove courses, as well as add and remove data from each course's DB.

## Frontend

Implemented with bootsrap using the following components:

1. Login Screen

2. Main Page - Dashboard
User can see his current grades and all courses he is signed up for.

3. Course Page
User can see all data relevant to course he's currently in using a table format, divided into sub-categories.

## Login System

TBD

## Testing and CI

1. github actions
2. pytest

## Issues and Dillemas

1. Can we implement feature that gets grades from Moodle? (Privacy issue) If not, can add feature that user's add their grades manually.
