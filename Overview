Tutor - Sharing Towards Excellence

Overview

Tutor is an open-source application for students, made by students.
Using Tutor, you can share helpful information you have stumbled upon online, summaries you wrote, and have all the information you need for every course at the tip of your fingertips.

Sign up to the subjects your'e enrolled in and see what helped other students understand the material better and get great grades in the course. 

If your school uses Moodle, Tutor can automatically check for updated HW grades and display your grades in one simple-to-use dashboard, so you know where your'e standing.
